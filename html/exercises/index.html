    <p>If I could create anything using the super powers of coding, I would create a web development app that creates the perfect trading tools to use when trading FOREX. I used to teach a team of 15 members on the rules and outlines of trading. Before I had these superpowers, I created an algorithm that was absolutely fool proof! Tested it numerous times and now I am ready to create the program that allows algorithms to protray the best possible trades.</p>
